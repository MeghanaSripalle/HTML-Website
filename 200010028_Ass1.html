    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
     <p>
        The history of Paris dates back to approximately <u>259 BC</u>, with the Parisii, a Celtic tribe settled on the banks of the Seine. In <u>52 BC</u>, the fishermen village was conquered 
        by the Romans, founding a Gallo-Roman town called Lutetia.The city changed its name to Paris during the fourth century. During this period, the city was threatened by Attila
        the Hun and his army, and according to the legend, the inhabitants of Paris resisted the attacks thanks to the providential intervention of Saint Geneviève (patron saint of the city).
        In <u>508 AD</u> the first king of the Franks, Clovis I, made Paris the capital of his empire. In <u>987</u>, the Capetian dynasty came to power until <u>1328</u>.<br>
        During the <i>eleventh century</i>, Paris gradually became more prosper thanks to its trade in silver and because it was a strategic route for pilgrims and traders. 
        From the <i>twelfth century</i>  on, Paris suffered important changes with the reconstruction of different neighborhoods, many damaged during World War I and World War II.<br>

     <h3>Arc de Triomphe</h3>
     <p title="Arc de Triomphe description">
        <b><i>The Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile </i></b>is one of the most famous monuments in Paris, France, standing at the western end of the Champs-Élysées at the centre of Place Charles de Gaulle,
        formerly named Place de l'Étoile—the étoile or "star" of the juncture formed by its twelve radiating avenues. The location of the arc and the plaza is shared between three arrondissements,
        16th (south and west), 17th (north), and 8th (east).<br/>

    <h3>Basilica of Sacré-Cœur </h3>
    <p title="Sacre Coeur">
        The Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris, commonly known as Sacré-Cœur Basilica,  is a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica in Paris, France, dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<br/>
        Sacré-Cœur Basilica is located at the summit of the butte Montmartre, the highest point in the city. It is a popular landmark, and the second-most visited monument in Paris.
        It is considered as both a political and cultural monument, representing a national penance for the defeat of France in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War and for the actions of the socialist 
        Paris Commune of 1871.The overall style of the structure shows a free interpretation of Romano-Byzantine features.
        Many design elements of the basilica symbolise nationalist themes: the portico, with its three arches, is adorned by two equestrian statues of French national saints Joan of Arc (1927) 
        and King Saint Louis IX.The basilica complex includes a garden for meditation, with a fountain. The top of the dome is open to tourists and affords a spectacular panoramic view of the 
        city of Paris, which is mostly to the south of the basilica.<br>
        The use of cameras and video recorders is forbidden inside the basilica.

     <h2>CULTURE</h2>
     <h3>Art and Sculptures</h3>
     <p>
        Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists
        to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as <i>Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou</i> acquired
        reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France.Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period.
     </p>
     <aside>
        For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world, who arrive in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration from its vast pool of artistic resources and galleries.

     <p>
        Paris was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century.

     <h3>Music and Jazz</h3>
     <p>
        Paris is a major centre for jazz and attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.
        Paris is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the 
        first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.
        Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, 
        and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.
     </p>
     <p>
        Jazz was introduced to Paris during World War I by a black American army band led by James Reese Europe,
         and took by storm the Paris music halls of the 1920s. It had a resurgence of popularity after World War II, 
         where jazz clubs flourished in the cellars of the quarter of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.Today a wide variety 
         of jazz is played in Paris clubs, which often have two performances at night and stay open until four in the morning.
     </p>
     <p>
         <cite>Notable clubs cited in a March 2015 survey of the best Paris jazz clubs by the Washington Post include the 'Caveau de la Huchette', the 'Improviste', the 'Café Universel' on Rue Saint Jacques.</cite>
